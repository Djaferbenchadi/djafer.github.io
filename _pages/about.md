I am **Benchadi Djafer Yahia.M**, a Ph.D. candidate working in [CVLAB](https://en.home.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/) at [University of Tsukuba](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/). Under the supervision of [Prof. Kazuhiro Fukui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sHcEkmAAAAAJ&hl=en). I am currently working on projects involving machine learning for malware detection, spoofing applications and cyber security.
