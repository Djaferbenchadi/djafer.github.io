I am a Ph.D. candidate working in [CVLAB](https://en.home.cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/) at University of Tsukuba. Under the supervision of Prof. Kazuhiro Fukui. I am currently working on projects involving machine learning for malware detection, spoofing applications and cyber security. 

Originally from Batna city, I graduated from University of Mohammed Khider Biskra (class of 2020) with a BS in Computer Science and MS in Networking and Telecommunications. 

My overall goal is to advance in the field of cybersecurity and machine learning by continuing to learn the skills and expertise to become a reliable researcher focused on positive societal impact via effective work in industry and government.
