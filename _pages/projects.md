##  Malware Family Classification 
- Implemented Kernel Subspace Method (KSM) for malware classification based on representative digital images. [[code]](https://github.com/Djaferbenchadi/Malware_classification_ksm) [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10244023)
- Results published in IEEE access.
  
##  Malware Spoofing (Binary) 
- Developed a method based on Kernel Constrained Subspace Method (KCSM) and Random Fourier Features (RFF). [[code]](https://github.com/Djaferbenchadi/Malware_analysis_binary) [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10215631)
- Tackled malware spoofing task, distinguishing between malware and Benign (safe) files.
- Results published in MVA2023.

##  Malware Visualization (Behavior) 
- Proposed novel visualization framework (OSA_KDS) for understanding malware behavior. [[code]](https://github.com/Djaferbenchadi/OSA_KDS) [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10244023)
- Framework implemented using Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis and Kernel Difference Subspace.
- Provided insights into malware features, aiding in reverse-engineering and cybersecurity analysis.
- Results published on IEEE access.
